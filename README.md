# MySQL-Management-Console-
This is kinda basic version of MySQL Studio.
If you are bored writing MySQL queries on that black screen, this will definitely gonna be your friend.
This was designed by me with few of colleagues under my mentor.
we have used Tkinter to give it more user friendly visuals.
